# Minimum Coins

In this exercise, you should write a function `minCoins` that takes a numeric value and returns the minimum number of coins needed to make such an amount.

We'll be using the British currency, so valid coins are £1, £2, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, and 1p).

Your function should expect a single argument as input, which will be a number representing a value in pounds.

```js
minCoins(0) // 0
minCoins(1) // 1
minCoins(2.75) // 4
```
