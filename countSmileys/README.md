# Count Smileys

In this exercise, you should write a function that counts the number of smiley faces in a given text.

A smiley face is formed using a pair of eyes (`:` or `;`), an optional nose (`-` or `~`), and a smiley mouth (`)`, `D`, or `]`).

Some examples of a valid smiley face:
```
:]
:-D
;~)
```

And invalid ones:
```
=]
:-}
xD
```

And the last thing to note is that smiley faces must not be surrounded by any characters other than a white space or a new line

```
:) valid
>:) invalid
:)) invalid
```
